In this graduate seminar we will explore statistical frontiers in foundation models and large language models (LLMs).

Course Description
======
*Statistical Frontiers in Foundation Models and LLMs* explores the emerging intersection between modern statistical thinking and the capabilities of large-scale foundation models such as large language models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and diffusion models. While foundation models have achieved remarkable empirical success, they raise foundational questions about uncertainty, reliability, generalization, and inference—core concerns of the statistical sciences. This course examines how statistical tools and perspectives can help us rigorously evaluate, understand, and extend the capabilities of these models, and how in turn, foundation models may offer new tools for statisticians.

We begin by introducing foundation models from a statistical viewpoint, emphasizing why concepts such as calibration, entropy, and generalization remain central in the age of large-scale deep learning. Students will critically examine techniques for evaluating model reliability, including calibration accuracy, posterior consistency, and other statistical quantities. The seminar then turns to modern approaches for uncertainty quantification in generative models and LLMs, such as conformal prediction and deep ensembles, highlighting both the theoretical underpinnings and practical challenges of deploying these systems in safety-critical domains. Finally, we explore how foundation models can be used to perform statistical tasks themselves—such as assisting in Bayesian inference, simulation-based inference, and prediction-powered inference—marking a shift from models as objects of analysis to models as computational subroutines in statistical tasks.

Throughout the course, students will engage deeply with contemporary research papers at the frontier of statistics and machine learning, with an emphasis on developing the tools to evaluate and innovate in this rapidly evolving landscape.
