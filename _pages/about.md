I am an Assistant Professor of Statistics at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, where I work at the intersection of machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and AI. My research focuses on developing reliable and efficient learning algorithms, with an emphasis on scientific and medical applications.

I hold a PhD in Computer Science and an MS in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University, and a BS in Mathematics from MIT. Prior to joining academia, I served as Lead Research Scientist at the Bosch Center for AI, where I led technical strategy on foundation models and hybrid modeling, contributing to over 30 patent applications across industrial AI use cases.

My current work explores the statistical foundations of model reliability, generalization, and adaptability in modern machine learning systems.
